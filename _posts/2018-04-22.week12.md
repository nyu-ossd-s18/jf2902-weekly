Group Project Progress
----------------------

This week started with the good news that we had our pull request accepted and merged! We then regrouped on Tuesday with plans to look for at least one more, so that all members have at least one 'official' commit. We also have one backup plan: to work on updating unit tests for the password list that we submitted to Django. Therefore, Tuesday and Wednesday's meetings have been greatly focused on triaging issues, which has been a problem because Django seems to be in a lull for the past week or so (which was a problem in the beginning for us, so we're not entirely surprised). I also wrote up the meeting's minutes on Wednesday, where we triaged for more issues before deciding to claim one of the issues that we've found from the beginning but weren't too confident about (the Farsi font issue, issue #29122). We also planned what we're going to do until the rest of the semester, notated in Wednesday's minutes.
