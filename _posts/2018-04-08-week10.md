Reflection on Danna Kelmer's Talk 
---------------------------------

I enjoyed the talk, especially the first half/45 minutes when Danna talked about Google's open source projects and its open source philosophy. I didn't know that Google worked on over 2000 open source projects, although the fact that most projects started internally and then externalized over time wasn't too surprising. Google's belief that "Open is Better" was new to me, personally as a user, it never came across to me that Google realy advertised that policy (other than through the Google Summer of Code, which I knew about). I thought that the question and answer section was also enlightening and helpful.   

##### What do you think about Google's approach to open source?  

I think that Google has a good approach to open source, as shown through the 2000 projects that its employees are currently working on. The 2 day response cycle that Danna mentioned means that the main contributors (Google employees) are dedicated to being active members of the community. In addition, programs such as Google's Summer of Code introduces the concept of open source to younger people, which will help increase awareness in the long run.   

Group Project Progress
----------------------

##### Report on team project progress - concentrating on your own contributions to the team.  

This week, our team finally decided to continue working on Django and continued triaging issues. We found that the "easy pickings" labeling system wasn't really enforced and was labeled voluntarily, there were easy tickets (issues) that were available but not labeled as such. We particularly found one that was doable and I claimed it on Wednesday's group meeting.  

On Thursday's class meeting, in addition to Shiyang updating and organizing our team's GitHub project page, we delved further into the issue that we claimed. We split the issue at hand into different tasks (on the project page) that we need to accomplish, and also completed some of them during the meeting. I updated our Django fork so that it's even with the master, and found the file in question that we need to modify (common-passwords.txt.gz). We also searched through the entire repo that referenced the file, to make sure that our change wouldn't crash the entire thing. We also identified several issues/questions that we might ask the community for help.  

The goal is for us to try to write a patch and run Django's test suite on our own (with our different operating systems), and documenting our personal issues/bugs before reconvening and working through them. We're thinking about adding another meeting before Tuesday (it might end up being remote) to push things along quicker.


Go Community Code of Conduct
----------------------------

##### Explain the benefits of having a code of conduct document for a project.  

##### Do you think that other projects would benefit from having such document?  

##### Does the project that your team is working on have a code of conduct document?  

Yes, Django has a code of conduct: [Link](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/)
